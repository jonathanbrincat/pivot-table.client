# SBX Data Explorer

Built upon the React + Vite boilerplate. Dec. 2023.

This is a prototype piece for the Streetbees Copilot Dashboard exploring and proofing an approach to produce tooling to probe and relay the surveyed data to the user for deeper examination and assist with the discovery of insights.

It has been built in React to facilitate fluid conversion of ideas into working concepts that can be reviewed and evolved into a refined product and to leverage the rich JavaScript ecosystem.
